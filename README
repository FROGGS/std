== Perl 6 Parser Stuff in the Pugs Repo

This is a start of some notes about what's going on in this magical directory
of pugs/Perl6. Larry mostly hacks in here, I think.

== Prerequisites

You'll need the following Perl stuff to run stuff:

* Perl 5.10.0 in /usr/local/bin/
* YAML::Syck
* Moose

== Running Stuff

You can get started by using the following Makefile commands:

> make
> make all
> make check
> make try
> make try cat
> make clean
> make distclean

== The End

for now...
