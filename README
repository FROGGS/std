=head1 Perl 6 Parser Stuff in the Pugs Repo

This is a start of some notes about what's going on in this magical
directory of pugs/src/perl6.  It is the home of STD.pm, the canonical
Perl 6 grammar, which is written in Perl 6, setting us all a typical
chicken-or-egg bootstrapping challenge.  So Larry has devised a cunning
Perl 6 to Perl 5 translator for just this job, called "gimme5".  Running
C<make> tells gimme5 to convert STD.pm into a Perl 5 script called
"viv".

Using "viv" with the -e option will output an Abstract Syntax Tree for
your input program.  The AST is in YAML format.

=head1 Prerequisites

You'll need the following Perl bits to run stuff:

* Perl 5.10.0 in /usr/local/bin/ 
  (using current perl with eg `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/perl /usr/local/bin`)

* YAML::XS       (eg sudo apt-get install libyaml-libyaml-perl)

* Moose          (eg sudo apt-get install libmoose-perl)
